🌱 Branching Strategy
We follow a simple Git branching model:

- dev → integration branch for new features
- feature/* → individual feature branches (e.g., feature/favorites-page, feature/personalization)
- hotfix/* → urgent fixes applied to main
Example workflow:
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/favorites-page

# Work on your changes
git commit -m "feat(favorites): render movies from localStorage"

# Push branch
git push origin feature/favorites-page

# Open a Pull Request into dev
